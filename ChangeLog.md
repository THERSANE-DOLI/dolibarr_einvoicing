# CHANGELOG MODULE EINVOICING FOR [DOLIBARR ERP CRM](https://www.dolibarr.org)

## 1.0.3

FIX: The triggers no longer fail with "Class EInvoicing / PDPProviderManager not found" when the action
comes from a context that never went through the module screens (cron, CLI, REST API, bank import).

FIX: A discount on an invoice line no longer emits a ram:CategoryTradeTax inside its
allowance block. That element belongs to a document-level allowance or charge and the CII syntax
binding forbids it on a line (CII-SR-191); the VAT of the discount is already carried by the line
itself (issue #471).

NEW: When the e-invoicing platform (PDP/PA) confirms the refusal of a received supplier invoice,
the corresponding Dolibarr supplier invoice is automatically validated then abandoned (with a
dedicated close code, keeping the refusal and its reason as trace) and is excluded from the
accountancy transfer screen (issue #286).
